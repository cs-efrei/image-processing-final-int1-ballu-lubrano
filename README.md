Image Processing in C
In this group project we learnt how to do image processing on bmp images.
Image processing referring to methods to modify images, like making them blurry or in black and white.

We executed the program using C language with the files main.c, bmp8.c, bmp8.h, bmp24.c and bmp24.h

We firstly manipulated an 8-bit grayscale image processing where we implemented the features : 
- Load and save grayscale images
- Negative filter
- Brightness filter
- Threshold filter
- Box blur
- Gaussian blur
- Outline filter
- Emboss filter 
- Sharpen filter

We then moved on to the 24-bit image and color image processing, where we implemented the same previous features : 
- Load and save color images
- Negative filter
- Grayscale filter
- Brightness filter
- Box blur
- Gaussian blur
- Outline filter
- Emboss filter
- Sharpen filter

We lastly used histogram equalization, which distributes the values of pixels of an image more equally.
We obtain an equalized image, that is more contrasted, which is useful for too bright or too dark images.
